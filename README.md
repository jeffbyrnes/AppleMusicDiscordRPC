# Apple Music Discord Presence

*Note: This project is still WIP, but stable. More functions will be added.* 

**This program is made to give similar experience to apple music users compared to spotify.**

## Preview

## Functions 
- Changes album graphic according to genre. (90% accurate.)<br>(If metadata of song is not given, presence will display default picture.)
- Displays your song name and album. 
- "Listen On Apple Music" will take you to apple music url of your currently playing music. <br> (This only works when the song is available in Apple Music, US Storefront.)
- Displays how much time is left for your song to end. 
- Automatic script for macOS, just run ```sh macos.sh``` in program's directory. <br>(It will install all dependencies needed!)
- Special love to **IU**, all album covers will be displayed only for IU's music! (WIP)

**Unfortunately, ```windows.bat``` will not automatically install nodejs, but only lead you to installing website.**
